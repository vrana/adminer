# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I support only the last published version and the last development version (last commit).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, create a private bug at https://sourceforge.net/p/adminer/bugs-and-features/new/?private=1.

I handle security issues with top priority. If you don't hear from me in a week then please ping the bug. Once I accept the bug, the fix should be available and new version released within days. I will mark the bug as public after releasing a new version or declining the bug.
