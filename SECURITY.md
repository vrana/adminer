# Reporting security issues

To report a security issue, please [open a draft security advisory](https://github.com/pematon/adminer/security/advisories).

Security issues are handled with top priority. Once acknowledged, a fix should be available and new version released
as soon as possible. Security advisories will be made public after a fix and new version have been released,
or the advisory has been declined.

## Supported versions

Only the last published version and the last development version (last commit) are supported.
